## Overview of the Project

### Project: TO-DO LIST APPLICATION WITH LOCAL STORAGE

### Objective

The main objective of the to-do list application is to provide a user-friendly, efficient, and persistent task management solution. By leveraging local storage, the application ensures that users' tasks are saved and accessible even after closing the browser, without requiring server-side databases. The application aims to support the following functionalities:

Task Addition: Allow users to easily add new tasks to their list.

Task Viewing: Provide an intuitive interface to view all tasks.

Task Editing: Enable users to modify existing tasks.

Task Deletion: Allow users to remove tasks when they are no longer needed.

Data Persistence: Utilize local storage to save tasks between sessions, ensuring data persistence without the need for server storage.

User-Friendly Interface: Create a simple, clean, and responsive interface for ease of use across different devices.

Real-Time Updates: Ensure that all changes are immediately reflected in the user interface and saved in local storage.
